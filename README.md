# Houghton-County-Snow-Fall-Analysis-in-R

I presented results of Houghton County Snowfall data, collected and maintained by Michigan Tech. Firstly, I analyzed maximum and minimum snowfall till 2016. According to my analysis January has maximum snowfall (52 Inches) and May has minimum snowfall (3 Inches) in Houghton County and Average snowfall is 19.5 inches. Secondly, I predicted snowfall for upcoming years using statistical and predictive models like Auto regressive Moving Average, Linear Regression, Moving Average and Neural Networks. Finally, I did cross-validation for above mentioned models using current data-set and concluded that Moving Average and Neural Network models fits best for the given dataset. The results from this study offer insights of snowfall patterns changing over time. As per my predictions In 2016-2018 maximum snowfall will be recorded in the month of January between 55 inches to 65 inches.
